# ![Icon](https://github.com/UnterrainerInformatik/BloomEffectRenderer/raw/master/icon.png) BloomEffectRenderer

This class is a PCL library for MonoGame that implements a bloom effect.  
If you'd like your game to truly shine, you can use this little beauty without much hassle.  
The problem with that brute-force-approach is, that the number of checks grow very fast (NÂ² for N sprites)

## Getting Started

```c#
private Point Resolution { get; } = new Point(1920, 1080);
private Renderer Renderer { get; } = new Renderer();

protected override void LoadContent()
{
  ...
  Renderer.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice);
  ...
}

protected override void UnloadContent()
{
  ...
  Renderer?.UnloadContent();
  ...
}

protected override void Initialize()
{
  base.Initialize();
  Renderer.Initialize(graphics.GraphicsDevice, Resolution);
}

protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
  // Image is some Texture2D that will be drawn to the backbuffer in this example.
  // (hence the <null>).
  // To bloom your game in a post-process step, draw all your assets to a
  // RenderTarget2D first and then pass that rendertarget to this method.
  Renderer.Render(graphics.GraphicsDevice, spriteBatch, "image", Image, null, Settings.PRESET_SETTINGS[1]);
  base.Draw(gameTime);
}
```
