# ![Icon](https://github.com/UnterrainerInformatik/BloomEffectRenderer/raw/master/icon.png) BloomEffectRenderer

This class is a PCL library for MonoGame that implements a bloom effect.  
If you'd like your game to truly shine, you can use this little beauty without much hassle.  
The problem with that brute-force-approach is, that the number of checks grow very fast (NÂ² for N sprites)

## Getting Started

This project is based on the following blog posts:

* http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/bloom
* https://digitalerr0r.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/xna-shader-programming-tutorial-23-blur-post-process/
* https://digitalerr0r.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/xna-shader-programming-tutorial-24-bloom/

You don't have to mess with shaders since those are included in the distribution.



### Attributions

Thx to the [MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended) project for their excellent work and teaching me how to embed shaders into a DLL.

Thx to [Jjagg](https://github.com/Jjagg) for reviewing the shaders.



### Example

```c#
private Point Resolution { get; } = new Point(1920, 1080);
private Renderer Renderer { get; } = new Renderer();

protected override void LoadContent()
{
  ...
  Renderer.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice);
  ...
}

protected override void UnloadContent()
{
  ...
  Renderer?.UnloadContent();
  ...
}

protected override void Initialize()
{
  base.Initialize();
  Renderer.Initialize(graphics.GraphicsDevice, Resolution);
}

protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
  // Image is some Texture2D that will be drawn to the backbuffer in this example.
  // (hence the <null>).
  // To bloom your game in a post-process step, draw all your assets to a
  // RenderTarget2D first and then pass that rendertarget to this method.
  Renderer.Render(graphics.GraphicsDevice, spriteBatch, "image", Image, null, Settings.PRESET_SETTINGS[1]);
  base.Draw(gameTime);
}
```

### Debugging

You may access any of the intermediate images produced by the renderer.

For that you'll have to pass a delegate when calling `Render()` like so:

```C#
// Your delegate. This one saves the images with some unique name, but you
// could also render them directly onto another RenderTarget, for example.
private void BloomDebugDelegate(string name, RenderTarget2D t, RenderPhase phase)
{
  FileStream fs = new FileStream($"{((int)phase)+1}{name}_{phase}.png", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
  t.SaveAsPng(fs, texture2D.Width, texture2D.Height);
  fs.Flush();
  fs.Close();
}

// And call the renderer like so:
Renderer.Render(graphics.GraphicsDevice, spriteBatch, "image", Image, null, Settings.PRESET_SETTINGS[1], BloomDebugDelegate);
```

This will call your delegate once for every render-phase.

```C#
[PublicAPI]
public enum RenderPhase
{
  /// <summary>
  /// The original texture is processed and all values above
  /// the bloomthreshold are kept.
  /// </summary>
  EXTRACT,
  /// <summary>
  /// The extract-texture is blured horizontally via a gaussian
  /// blur and resized to half the size.
  /// </summary>
  BLUR_HORIZONTAL,
  /// <summary>
  /// The horizontally blurred texture is blurred again 
  /// vertically (size is kept at half).
  /// </summary>
  BLUR_VERTICAL,
  /// <summary>
  /// This step re-combines the original texture and the 
  /// two-times-blurred texture to a new image.
  /// </summary>
  COMBINE
}
```



## TestGame

A test-project is included. You can manipulate the values of the shaders directly and see what happens.

Here are a few screenshots:
